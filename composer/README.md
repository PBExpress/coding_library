# Composer

#### Introduction <a href="#introduction" id="introduction"></a>

[Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) is a popular dependency management tool for PHP, created mainly to facilitate installation and updates for project dependencies. It will check which other packages a specific project depends on and install them for you, using the appropriate versions according to the project requirements. Composer is also commonly used to bootstrap new projects based on popular PHP frameworks, such as [Symfony](https://symfony.com/) and [Laravel](https://laravel.com/).

In this tutorial, youâ€™ll install and get started with Composer on an Ubuntu 20.04 system.
